# Week 1 Tasks

1. Write a program in Dart to declare a list of integers and find the maximum element in the list.
2. Write a program in Dart to sort the list you had initialized earlier (write the full sorting algorithm without using the in-built sort method).
3. Create a Student class in Dart and add name, branch and age attributes, a constructor to initialize all the attributes and a class method to print values of all the attributes, and initialize two different objects with some values and call the method in the main function.
4. Use equality operators (==) and check if the two objects of same class, having the same attribute values, return true.
(Object1 == Object2 gives true/false)
